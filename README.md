# Pyramid-fuse

```
A Semantic Segmentation architecture developed to process Equirectangular images. This work was done as a part of internship at Smart Viewing, UK. The input to the network is an Equirectangular RGB Image which is then converted to a cubemap representation and processed parallelly.

This repo is under development and will be updated very soon. Please keep Checking the To-Do list for status of development.
```

# ToDo
```
[ ] Train with Stanford2D3D
[ ] Upload results and pre-trained model
[ ] Clean code
